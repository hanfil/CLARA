# CLARA

CLARA (Contextual Local Analysis & Responder Agent) is a zero-touch cybersecurity appliance ‚Äì a simple plug-and-play device delivering enterprise-grade protection.

Clear **liability terms**: An *AI is only advisory assistant and do* *Mitigation with the users approval*. The user is the boss. Every action and firewall setting has the human approved. Clara is only as secure as the human is trained to be; like if they don‚Äôt use 2FA or and uses the same password every place. Clara can‚Äôt protect against that. So CLARA will have to train the users behavior to be more secure. For example Clara‚Äôs firewall change prompts for a 2FA and Clara ships with vault-warden(Bitwarden server).
